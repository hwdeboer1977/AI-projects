    "url_content": "Since the Pi Network mainnet launched on February 20, it has made headlines for its ambitious goals. Yet, it has also faced substantial criticism. The underwhelming price performance and lack of DApps, among other issues, have raised questions about Pi Network’s ability to meet the expectations of its reported 60 million users, referred to as Pioneers.\nBelow are five key areas of underperformance that emerged as focal points for observers in early 2025.\nPi Network’s community has been vocal in its push for a listing on major exchanges like Binance. In fact,86% of participants voted to listPi Coin (PI) in a February community vote.\nDespite this show of support, Binance has not listed PI. On May 15, the exchange posted its logo on X (formerly Twitter)  featuring several mathematical symbols, including π.  The post sparked speculation among Pioneers, but noofficial listing announcement followed.\nThis is what happens when devs touch art with 0 design sense.pic.twitter.com/8kzFW8KcEM\nThe absence of a listing has led to renewed scrutiny over Pi Network’s credibility. Notably, Binance applies a rigorous evaluation process before listing any asset.\nThe exchangeconsidersuser adoption, business model viability, relevance,tokenomics, technicalsecurity, team background, and compliance with regulatory standards. The decision not to list Pi Coin may indicate that the project has yet to meet one ormore of these critical benchmarks.\n“I now better understand why Pi is not listed on major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. It is likely that the Pi Core Team has not been transparent enough about the locking and burning mechanism involving the billions of Pi coins currently owned by the PCT,” Pioneer Dr. Altcoinpostedon March 22.\nCoinbase, another top exchange, has also refrained from listing Pi. This has further fueled disappointment among Pioneers about the token’s potential for mainstream adoption. Nonetheless, Pi Coin remains availablefor trading on HTX, Bitget, MEXC, and OKX.\nPioneers have been actively mining Pi Coin for around six years, anticipating major gains. Yet, its price was a major letdown for many. At launch, Pi Coin was listed onOKX with a floor price of just $2. This was way below its IOU trading value.",

This launch is paired with a strategic integration withbitsCrunch, a leading provider of NFT analytics and pricing infrastructure. Together, the partnership enables a more intelligent and transparent NFT lending experience on the Berachain network.\nNFT Money Market is a market-specific lending model that allows NFT holders to secure instant liquidity by borrowing against their assets through isolated pools. Unlike traditional peer-to-peer lending, where loan terms are matched manually, the NFT Money Market’s Peer-To-Pool enables users to interact with automated liquidity pools tailored to individual NFT collections and settlement tokens.\nEach pool is uniquely configured based on:\nThis model significantly reduces systemic risk. Because each pool is isolated by both asset and collateral type, risk remains contained within that market, even if other pools experience highvolatilityor liquidation events.\nNFT holders can deposit their assets into PaddleFi’s vault system and borrow funds almost instantly, as long as their loan terms remain within the allowed thresholds. Lenders, on the other hand, contribute capital to specific NFT markets they trust and receive iTokens (interest-bearing tokens) that represent their share in the pool and accrue yield over time.\nAll loans are open-ended, meaning they can be repaid at any time, offering maximum flexibility to users. If a borrower’s position exceeds the defined borrowing limit for that specific market, only their NFT collateral in that pool becomes subject to liquidation. Other assets in unrelated markets remain unaffected.\nNFT holders have long faced challenges accessing liquidity due to the non-fungible nature of their assets, inconsistent pricing mechanisms, and limited support from traditional DeFi platforms.\nThe NFT Money Market directly addresses these issues by eliminating the need for manual loan matching and reducing wait times. Its isolated pool design shields lenders from broader market volatility, while dynamic pricing and tailored collateral parameters improve capital efficiency.\nWith open-ended loan durations, borrowers can access liquidity without strict repayment timelines, making the system both flexible and user-friendly.\nPaddleFi’s integration with bitsCrunch’s Price Index API brings critical improvements to how NFT collateral is evaluated and managed. The API delivers real-time pricing data, enabling precise calculation of borrow limits and collateral thresholds. It also supports more accurate liquidation logic by factoring in current floor prices and market volatility.",

Especially true in crypto, where the mantra remains: “Wen moon?” Translation: “Are we finally at the bottom?”\nFirst, a heads up: some of the technical analysis tools and methods discussed here might differ from conventional wisdom. Why? Because, just like any other field, trading theories and best practices evolve. It can take years for these updated practices to trickle down from the pros to retail traders. Sometimes, even the pros lag behind in adopting these changes!\nFor this piece, we’ll dissect the anatomy of a market bottom usingXRP, one of the most widely followedcryptocurrencies.\nNews is anecdotal.\nThat’s a polite way to say, “news doesn’t matter.” If you ever chase professional certifications like the CMT (Chartered Market Technician) or CFTe (Certified Financial Technician), you’ll dive into works like“Behavioral Investing”by James Montier, which tackles the effect of news on markets.\nThe TL;DR? News only matters if the price moves. If price doesn’t react meaningfully, the news is irrelevant. People simply look to the news as an explanation or a reason for something that happened.\nIf we want to buy XRP at the bottom, there’s several tools that can help identify and time it correctly. The two tools I’m going to focus on is theRSIand Stocktwits’ social sentiment data.\nIf you want to buy XRP at the bottom, the RSI can help. Heads up: you’ve probably been using RSI incorrectly – or, at least, not as efficiently as you could. Don’t feel bad, though. The way professionals interpret RSI shifted nearly 20 years ago… but again, even pros sometimes take ages to adapt.\nThe RSI (Relative Strength Index)is among the most familiar and utilized indicators among traders.\nIn 1978, J.

This growth reflects the increasing demand for applications on Solana, particularly inmeme coins, DEXs, andcryptocurrency wallets.\nSolana’s recovery can be attributed to several factors, including low transaction fees and high processing speeds, which are competitive advantages of this blockchain compared to rivals like Ethereum.\nAmong the Dapps on Solana,Pump.fun emergedas a standout leader with a revenue of $257 million, accounting for a significant portion of the ecosystem’s total revenue.\nThe success of Pump.fun can be explained by the ongoing trend of meme coins capturing the community’s attention, particularly following the launch of the Trump meme coin on January 17, which boosted trading activity on Solana. However, the rapid explosion of Pump.fun has brought manybad consequencesto the market.\nFollowing Pump.fun is thePhantom wallet, which secured second place with a revenue of $164 million.

It signifies a transformative leap from industry leadership to innovation leadership, and from technical excellence to global strategic expansion.\nPreviously,Gatealso adopted a new Chinese name “Damen” ( 大门, meaning “The Gate”), symbolizing an open gateway to the future of crypto for users worldwide.

Although this was a net positive in terms of inflow intothese funds, last week’s figure was the lowest weekly inflow in the past month. This highlights a more cautious but sustained capital movement into the market.\nThe slowdown in ETF inflows can be linked to BTC price consolidation during the five-day period under review. Throughout that period, BTC traded sideways, facing resistance at around $104,971 while finding consistent support at $102,711.\nThis lack of clear movement likely led some investors to be more cautious, resulting in reduced capital inflows into BTC ETFs last week.\nStill, bullish momentum persists in the BTC market. The king coin briefly surged to a three-month high of $107,108 during Monday’s early Asian trading session.

    "url_content": "Bitcoin has faced notablevolatilityin recent days, with strong market growth on Sunday, followed by a complete wipeout on Monday.\nDespite these fluctuations, the hope for a recovery remains, fueled by FOMO (fear of missing out) and greed-driven investors. These sentiments could play a crucial role in Bitcoin’s price movement.\nThe continued decline in exchange balances signals a pattern of accumulation. Over the past week, more than 27,976 BTC, worth over $2.88 billion, was purchased by investors. This has reduced the available supply to approximately 3 million BTC.\nThe idea that Bitcoin has not yet reached its all-time high (ATH) encourages further investment, as many believe the current price levels represent an opportunity that won’t last long. FOMO remains a significant driver, as retail and institutional investors alike bet onBitcoin’s future potential.\nThe IOMAP (In/Out of the Money Around Price) indicator suggests that Bitcoin has strong support around the $102,886 to $99,894 range, where investors have accumulated over 398,590 BTC worth more than $41 billion. This makes the region a strong buying zone, with many investors holding onto their positions in anticipation of Bitcoin’s next upward movement.\nA decline below this support is unlikely because investors are waiting for a price increase rather than selling. In addition to the strong accumulation zone, the general market sentiment is bullish. The ongoing support at these levels reinforces the view thatBitcoin is positioned to continueits rise.\nBitcoin is currently trading at $102,907, just above the critical $102,734 support level. Despite today’s 3.3% drop, further price declines seem unlikely due to the strong demand zone just below this level. Buyers appear willing to step in at these price points, suggesting stability in the short term.\nWithBitcoin having briefly risento $107,108 earlier in the day, it seems likely the cryptocurrency will recover its losses. Investor accumulation is expected to push Bitcoin higher, and it could breach the $105,000 level again, forming consolidation above the $102,734 support. This would set Bitcoin on course for continued growth, bringing it closer to its ATH of $109,588, which it stands 6.5% away from.\nHowever, the bullish outlook could be invalidated if long-term holders (LTHs) decide to sell off their positions to secure profits. If this happens,Bitcoin’s pricecould slip below the critical $102,734 support, potentially bringing it down to the $100,000 range.\nDisclaimer",

The investor withdrew 1.79 trillion PEPE—valued at $22.23 million—from Binance into a newly activated wallet.\nA day later, the whale withdrew another 420 billion PEPE tokens, worth roughly $5.39 million, from the crypto trading platform.\nBook your next stay with discounts of up to 65% with WIREX Card and get up to 8% cashback on all bookings.\nAs a result, the whale has now removed 2.21 trillion PEPE tokens, worth $29 million, from Binance in two separate transactions during a 24-hour period.\nMarket observersnotedthat these actions have effectively reduced Binance’s PEPE reserves by about 2%.\nThewithdrawals, directed into self-custody wallets,suggest a deliberate accumulation strategy and signal the whale’s confidence in the token’s long-term value. Typically, such behavior reflects a shift away from short-term speculation toward a buy-and-hold approach.\nMeanwhile, the whale’s return and the rapid accumulation of tokens coincided witha PEPE price rally.\nAccording to BeInCrypto data, the meme coin has surged over 10% in the last 24 hours and now trades at $0.00001345. This marks a staggering 87.5% gain in the past month alone.",
