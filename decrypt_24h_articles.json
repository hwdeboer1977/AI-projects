Working together, they validate transactions and maintain Ethereum's security.\nHaving a full node is valuable as it means a user can maintain a local server that could run Ethereum's server as if they were local, Buterin explained.\nWith a full node, users can \"read the chain in a trustless, censorship-resistant, and privacy-friendly way,\"  ButerinwroteSunday in the Ethereum Research blog.\nBut running a full node today means storing over1.3 terabytesof data, according to data from Etherscan. Without serious hardware or cloud resources, most people can't do it, given the costs.\n\"Currently, the overhead is impractically high, and even after many efficiency improvements, it is likely to stay expensive,\" Buterin noted.\n\"Instead of storing all blockchain data, nodes would only keep the portions they need, while historical data older than 36 days gets distributed across multiple nodes for shared storage,\" Ryan Yoon, senior analyst at Tiger Research, toldDecrypt.\n\"Think of it like a library system—you don't need every book in your local branch if you can request them from other libraries when needed,\" he added.",

Let's explore how you'd go about tokenizing a painting:\nFor Morgan Krupetsky, Head of Institutions and Capital Markets at Ava Labs, tokenization is crucial for unlocking global access to traditionally restricted financial products and puts previously illiquid assets to work by enabling them to be used as collateral throughDeFi.\n“Tokenization allows almost anyone with an internet connection to now access USDs, USD-based savings accounts, U.S. equities, and alternative assets,” Krupetsky toldDecrypt. “It also enables the ability to more easily pledge assets as collateral and leverage DeFi primitives—putting historically trapped capital or illiquid positions to work.”",
