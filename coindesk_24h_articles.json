    "url_content": "Dubai's crypto regulator Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) has updated its rulebook for digital asset trading.\nThe emirati  regulator has introduced greater leverage controls and collateralization requirements through provisions in its Broker-Deal and Exchange Rulebooks. This will help VARA's rules to align with global risk standards, the regulator said in an emailed announcement on Monday.\nVARA has also introduced sections of its rulebook to properly oversee areas of the crypto industry that were previously lightly regulated, such as broker-dealers and wallets.\nThe rules previously laid out by VARA have helped establish the city as a crypto hub, winning praise from crypto companies for being reasonably clear in their requirements to operate there. Major exchanges such as Binance, Crypto.com and OKX have all won approvals under VARA.\nVARA is now taking these rules and upgrading them to reflect a more mature framework that it says incorporates real-world licensing experience and international best practices.\n\"These rulebook updates reinforce the foundations of a responsible, scalable ecosystem,” said Ruben Bombardi,General Counsel and Head of Regulatory Enablement at VARA, said in an emailed comment shared with CoinDesk.\nRead More:Dubai Government Opens Door to Accepting Crypto for Service Fees",

    "url_content": "Over $600 million in crypto derivatives positions have been liquidated since late Sunday as bitcoin (BTC) staged a sharp rally past $106,000 in the wee hours, only to reverse course and dump back to near $103,000, catching both bulls and bears off guard.\nThe move began around 21:00 UTC on Sunday, when bitcoin spiked more than $2,500 in less than an hour — a pattern that can be attributed to thin weekend liquidity and potential algorithmic buying triggered by technical levels.\nSuch price action was a textbook short squeeze followed by aggressive profit-taking or stop-run. A short squeeze happens when traders betting against a price (short sellers) are forced to buy the asset as it rises, to cover their losses, which pushes the price even higher and often very quickly.\nThe sudden move wiped outover $460 million in long positionsand $220 million in shorts, across futures tracking majors like ether (ETH), solana (SOL), and dogecoin (DOGE).\nThe liquidation wave was notable for occurring during traditionally quiet weekend hours, an unusual event that marks forced selling or buying activity by a major player.\nSOL, DOGE and XRP prices are down more than 4% in the past 24 hours,data shows, with the broad-based CoinDesk (CD20) down more than 2%.\nThe volatility follows a week of macro uncertainty, with Moody’s cutting the U.S. credit rating on Friday and inflation fears resurfacing after mixed economic data. The downgrade also led to U.S. 30-year treasury yields breaching the 5% mark.\nWhile crypto has broadly benefited from renewed institutional inflows and spot ETF momentum, traders remain cautious at current price levels,as reported.",

    "url_content": "The yield on the U.S. 30-year treasury bills crossed the 5% threshold for the first time since April, reaching an intraday high of 5.011%. This move comes in the wake ofMoody’s downgrading U.S. credit, stripping the country of Aaa rating due to mounting deficits and escalating interest expenses.\nThe last time the long end of the yield curve reached 5% was on April 9, during the so-called \"tariff tantrum,\" which triggered sharp sell-offs in both crypto and U.S. equity markets.\nAt that time, bitcoin (BTC) was hovering near its local low of around $75,000. It has since rebounded strongly, currently trading around $103,000 after hitting a Sunday high of $106,000.\n“The last time the 30-year closed at or above 5% (at the 6 PM ET mark) was October 31, 2023. The highest closing yield in recent memory was 5.11% on October 19, 2023, the highest since July 2007, nearly 18 years ago. The current yield is just 12 basis points away from surpassing that milestone,” said Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research.\nIn addition, theUnited Kingdomsurpassed China in March to become the second-largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, with holdings totaling $779.3 billion—trailing only Japan, which remains the top foreign holder.\nBoth China and Japan have continued to reduce their U.S. Treasury holdings over the past 12 months, underscoring the growing need for the U.S. to attract new buyers for its debt.\nAs the U.S. Treasury faces growing deficits, with the potential of more bonds being issued, increasing supply and thereby pushing yields higher while prices fall. Meanwhile, Nasdaq futures are down around 2%, reflecting broader risk-off sentiment in the market.",

The platform is available in Dubai, the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, Australia and Switzerland.\nRipple uses a global network of payout partners and blockchain infrastructure to move money in minutes. In some cases, it also uses its native digital asset, XRP, as a bridge currency through its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, allowing clients to instantly convert one fiat currency to another using the token.\nXRP prices are down 3.5% in the past 24 hours amid a broader market slump.

    "url_content": "When Galaxy Digital (GLXY) CEO Mike Novogratzbought Argos' Helios data center in late 2022, at the depths of the post-FTX crypto winter, the company thought they were bailing out a desperate bitcoin (BTC) miner on the brink of bankruptcy.\nThis, however, was before ChatGPT had become mainstream. Novogratz and co. had no idea that this data center would be a strategic asset as the growing Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry clamours for more data center space, thanks to the explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs).\nAs analysts fromRittenhouse Research outlined in a new note, Galaxy’s lucky find, which instigated the company's move out of BTC mining altogether, might now be crypto’s most lucrative pivot, as they make the case that the infrastructure used to mine digital gold is better used to process AI algorithms, and firms that shift away from BTC mining towards AI infrastructure are set to be the next growth stocks.\nAnalysts from Rittenhouse argue that AI data centers represent a significantly more lucrative business model than BTC mining because they generate stable, long-term cash flows with minimal ongoing capital expenditures, contrasting sharply with the volatility and capital intensity of bitcoin mining.\nBTC mining revenues inherently decline by approximately 50% every four years due to thescheduled halvinings. Effectively, the play for a miner is being a long-term bull on BTC's price and the ability for semiconductor fabs and designers to develop chips that are perpetually more efficient, and, for an investor, that's a lot of variables.\nIn contrast, AI data centers like Galaxy’s Helios facility earn consistent, high-margin revenue through long-term, triple net leases to hyperscaler tenants (a large-scale cloud computing provider), without needing continuous investment in mining equipment.\n“Galaxy stumbled upon Helios by virtue of good luck,” Rittenhouse wrote in their note. While competitors such as Riot Platforms and Cipher Mining have publicly tried to \"rewrite history,\" retroactively suggesting their business was always broader than BTC mining, analysts say, “in reality, these miners had zero intentions to do anything besides mine BTC until ChatGPT was launched.”\nGalaxy’s transition reflects a broader trend as BTC miners attempt to pivot toward AI and cloud computing.",

Both exchanges managed to block the attempts without losing any customer data.\nThe exchanges faced tactics mirroring those used against Coinbase (COIN), which earlier this week revealed it expects to pay $180 million to $400 million in remediation costs and customer reimbursements afterattackers gained access to their personal information.\nThat breach led to a $20 million ransom demand after the attackers managed to bribe Coinbase’s overseas employees/contractors to get customer information. The exchange has fired the staff involved and has contacted law enforcement.\nAt Binance, internal systems including artificial intelligence bots helped detect bribery-related messages, shutting down conversations before they escalated.

    "url_content": "Bitcoin's BTC price chart is echoing a bullish pattern that foreshadowed the late 2024 price surge from $70,000 to $100,000 amid mounting concerns over the sustainability of the U.S. debt.\nThe leading cryptocurrency by market value appears on track to confirm a \"golden cross\" in the coming days, according to charting platform TradingView. The pattern occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of prices crosses above the 200-day SMA to suggest that the short-term trend is outperforming the broader trend, with the potential to evolve into a major bull run.\nThe moving average-based golden cross has a mixed record of predicting price trends. The impending one, however, is worth noting because it's about to occur weeks after its ominous-sounding opposite, the death cross, trapped bears on the wrong side of the market.\nA similar pattern unfolded from August through September 2024, setting the stage for a convincing move above $70,000 in early November. Prices eventually set a record high above $109K in January this year.\nThe chart on the left shows that BTC bottomed out at around $50,000 in early August last year as the 50-day SMA moved below the 200-day SMA to confirm the death cross.\nIn other words, the death cross was a bear trap, much like the one in early April this year. Prices turned higher in subsequent weeks, eventually beginning a new uptrend after the appearance of the golden cross in late October 2024.\nThe bullish sequence is being repeated since early April, and prices could begin the next leg higher following the confirmation of the golden cross in the coming days.\nPast performance does not guarantee future results, and technical patterns do not always deliver as expected. That said, macro factors seem aligned with the bullish technical setup.",
